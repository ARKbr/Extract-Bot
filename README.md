# Extract-Bot

This software aims to automate the boring extraction process of password-protected files, when you know all the possible passwords.

This idea come from a persnal need of a tool to automate this process, then first i have created a script with this function, but then i decided to build the GUI, to help anyone that migth have this need and because was a good opportunity to learn more about PyQt5

I have also included a conversion tool for audio files, to fit my needs while organizing my library

There are possible improvements, such as Multi-threading for the extraction and conversion processes, but i dont need this for now, so feel free to make your fork of it :)
